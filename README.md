Overview

As a software engineer, I aim to deepen my expertise in mobile app development by building practical, user-friendly applications. The Mobile Task Manager App is a tool designed to help users organize tasks efficiently, enhancing my skills in Android development, UI design, and database management.

The app allows users to create, manage, and track tasks with features like:

Adding tasks with a description, category (Work, General, School, Health, Personal), and priority (High, Medium, Low) using dropdown menus.
Cycling through priorities (High → Medium → Low) by clicking the priority text.
Marking tasks as complete or incomplete with a checkbox.
Deleting tasks with a trash icon. 

To use the app, open it on an Android device or emulator, enter a task description, select a category and priority from dropdowns, and click "Add Task." Tasks appear in a list where you can check/uncheck, cycle priorities, or delete them.
My purpose for creating this app is to practice building a full-stack mobile application, integrating a Room database, Jetpack Compose for modern UI, and Kotlin coroutines for asynchronous operations. This project helps me learn to create intuitive interfaces and robust data persistence.

Development Environment

I developed the app using:

Android Studio: The primary IDE for coding, debugging, and running the app on a medium phone emulator.
Git and GitHub: For version control, with the repository at https://github.com/Jayner1/mobileTask.
Device File Explorer: To manage the Room database files.

The app is written in Kotlin and uses the following libraries:  
Jetpack Compose: For building the UI, including dropdowns, checkboxes, and buttons.
Room: For local database storage of tasks, categories, and priorities.
Kotlin Coroutines: For asynchronous database operations.
Material3: For theming with light/dark mode and dynamic colors.
Material Icons Extended: For the delete icon.

Future Work
Add task due dates to help users track deadlines.
Implement sorting or filtering tasks by category, priority, or completion status.
Enhance the UI with animations for task addition and deletion.
